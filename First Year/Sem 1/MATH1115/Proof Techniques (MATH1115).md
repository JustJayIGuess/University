# Proving the Contrapositive
>[!def]
>The *contrapositive* to $X \Rightarrow Y$ is $\text{not }Y\Rightarrow \text{not }X.$
>These two statements are **logically equivalent**.

# Proof by Contradiction
>[!def]
>In *proof by contradiction*, we are given $A$, and want to prove $B$.
>This is done by supposing $A$ and supposing $\text{not }B$, and showing that this leads to a logical impossibility.
