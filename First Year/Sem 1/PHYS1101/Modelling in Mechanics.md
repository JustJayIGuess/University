To solve problems involving moving bodies, we often find that we only need to consider some properties, i.e., it suffices to *model* the situation in a simplified manner. We will consider the point particle model and the rigid body model.

# Point Particle Model
In the point particle model, objects are represented by a point that has only a position and velocity. Point may also exert forces on each other, allowing complex situations to be modelled even by this simple model.
## Representations
>[!remark]
>One may *represent* or analyse a point particle or group of point particles with tools such as free-body diagrams, position graphs, velocity graphs or motion maps.

A *motion map* is a diagram showing the motion of an object over time.

A *free-body diagram* is a representation where the forces acting on an object are shown by arrows originating from the object at a particular time.

An *energy pie chart* shows a breakdown of the energy present in a scenario at any important points in time.

A *position, velocity or acceleration graph* is a graph with time on the x axis, and some quantification of the position, velocity or acceleration on the remaining axes.

>[!remark]
>One should always *check consistency* between these representations.

>[!remark]
>Once consistency is established, the model should be simplified, i.e., in terms of one of the four simple models of motion addressed in high school - *constant speed*, *constant acceleration*, *circular motion* or *simple harmonic motion*.
