A good way to go about modelling a circuit is to follow these steps:
- Simplify the circuit into a diagram, replacing all components with their idealised forms
- Draw arrows showing the direction of current based on voltage sources
- Consider how the amount of current may change when encountering a junction in the wire
- Consider what areas should be the same voltage; areas connected by ideal wires should all be of equal voltage
- Draw a graph showing how the voltage should change throughout the circuit
- Check consistency of the model with [[#Kirchhoff's Laws]]
	- When selecting loops, it is only necessary to select enough loops such that each component is included at least once
	- Choose a starting point to begin all loops

# Kirchhoff's Laws
Kirchhoff's first law states that the sum of currents entering a junction must be equal to the sum of currents exiting it.
Kirchhoff's second law states that, when going around a closed loop, the voltage must return to the same as it started. I.e., each point may only have one voltage.
Note that when modelling, it is helpful to remain consistent in the direction that you analyse loops, i.e., clockwise only or anticlockwise only.
