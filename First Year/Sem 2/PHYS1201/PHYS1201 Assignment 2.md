First, observe that the total kinetic energy of the system with respect to the centre of mass is,
$$
K = \frac{1}{2}m(\dot{x_{1}}^{2} + \dot{x_{2}}^{2}),
$$
where $x_1(t),x_2(t)$ are the positions of the two electrons in Cartesian coordinates. The two electrons are of equal mass, however, so the centre of mass is the midpoint of the two position vectors. As $x_1,x_2$ are relative to this centre of mass, we then have that,
$$\begin{align*}
x_{1} &= -x_{2}\\
\dot{x}_{1} &= -\dot{x}_{2}\\
\dot{x}_{1}^{2}&= \dot{x}_{2}^{2}.
\end{align*}$$
So then we have the following expression of kinetic energy.
$$\begin{align*}
K &= \frac{1}{2}m(2\dot{x}_{1}^{2})\\
&= m\dot{x}_{1}^{2}.
\end{align*}$$
The separation vector $x$ between $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ then has magnitude,
$$\begin{align*}
|x| &= 2|x_{1}| \Rightarrow |\dot{x}_{1}| = \frac{1}{2}|\dot{x}|.
\end{align*}$$
So then we can express kinetic energy as,
$$\begin{align*}
K &= m(\frac{1}{2}|\dot{x}|)^2\\
&= \frac{1}{4}m\dot{x}^{2}.
\end{align*}$$
If we now replace $x$ with the equivalent separation vector $r$ in polar form, recalling that $\dot{x}^{2} = \dot{r}^{2} + r^{2}\dot{\theta}^{2}$, we have,
$$\begin{align*}
K &= \frac{1}{4}m
\end{align*}$$
